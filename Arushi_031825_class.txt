  --score-min <func> min acceptable alignment score w/r/t read length
                     (L,0.0,-0.2)

 Reporting:
  -k <int>           It searches for at most <int> distinct, primary alignments for each read. Primary alignments mean
                     alignments whose alignment score is equal to or higher than any other alignments. The search terminates
                     when it cannot find more distinct valid alignments, or when it finds <int>, whichever happens first.
                     The alignment score for a paired-end alignment equals the sum of the alignment scores of
                     the individual mates. Each reported read or pair alignment beyond the first has the SAM ‘secondary’ bit
                     (which equals 256) set in its FLAGS field. For reads that have more than <int> distinct,
                     valid alignments, hisat2 does not guarantee that the <int> alignments reported are the best possible
                     in terms of alignment score. Default: 5 (linear index) or 10 (graph index).
                     Note: HISAT2 is not designed with large values for -k in mind, and when aligning reads to long,
                     repetitive genomes, large -k could make alignment much slower.
  --max-seeds <int>  HISAT2, like other aligners, uses seed-and-extend approaches. HISAT2 tries to extend seeds to
                     full-length alignments. In HISAT2, --max-seeds is used to control the maximum number of seeds that
                     will be extended. For DNA-read alignment (--no-spliced-alignment), HISAT2 extends up to these manyseeds
                     and skips the rest of the seeds. For RNA-read alignment, HISAT2 skips extending seeds and reports
                     no alignments if the number of seeds is larger than the number specified with the option,
                     to be compatible with previous versions of HISAT2. Large values for --max-seeds may improve alignment
                     sensitivity, but HISAT2 is not designed with large values for --max-seeds in mind, and when aligning
                     reads to long, repetitive genomes, large --max-seeds could make alignment much slower.
                     The default value is the maximum of 5 and the value that comes with -k times 2.
  -a/--all           HISAT2 reports all alignments it can find. Using the option is equivalent to using both --max-seeds

                     and -k with the maximum value that a 64-bit signed integer can represent (9,223,372,036,854,775,807).
  --repeat           report alignments to repeat sequences directly

 Paired-end:
  -I/--minins <int>  minimum fragment length (0), only valid with --no-spliced-alignment
  -X/--maxins <int>  maximum fragment length (500), only valid with --no-spliced-alignment
  --fr/--rf/--ff     -1, -2 mates align fw/rev, rev/fw, fw/fw (--fr)
  --no-mixed         suppress unpaired alignments for paired reads
  --no-discordant    suppress discordant alignments for paired reads

 Output:
  -t/--time          print wall-clock time taken by search phases
  --un <path>           write unpaired reads that didn't align to <path>
  --al <path>           write unpaired reads that aligned at least once to <path>
  --un-conc <path>      write pairs that didn't align concordantly to <path>
  --al-conc <path>      write pairs that aligned concordantly at least once to <path>
  (Note: for --un, --al, --un-conc, or --al-conc, add '-gz' to the option name, e.g.
  --un-gz <path>, to gzip compress output, or add '-bz2' to bzip2 compress output.)
  --summary-file <path> print alignment summary to this file.
  --new-summary         print alignment summary in a new style, which is more machine-friendly.
  --quiet               print nothing to stderr except serious errors
  --met-file <path>     send metrics to file at <path> (off)
  --met-stderr          send metrics to stderr (off)
  --met <int>           report internal counters & metrics every <int> secs (1)
  --no-head             suppress header lines, i.e. lines starting with @
  --no-sq               suppress @SQ header lines
  --rg-id <text>        set read group id, reflected in @RG line and RG:Z: opt field
  --rg <text>           add <text> ("lab:value") to @RG line of SAM header.
                        Note: @RG line only printed when --rg-id is set.
  --omit-sec-seq        put '*' in SEQ and QUAL fields for secondary alignments.

 Performance:

                     (L,0.0,-0.2)

 Reporting:
  -k <int>           It searches for at most <int> distinct, primary alignments for each read. Primary alignments mean
                     alignments whose alignment score is equal to or higher than any other alignments. The search terminates
                     when it cannot find more distinct valid alignments, or when it finds <int>, whichever happens first.
                     The alignment score for a paired-end alignment equals the sum of the alignment scores of
                     the individual mates. Each reported read or pair alignment beyond the first has the SAM ‘secondary’ bit
                     (which equals 256) set in its FLAGS field. For reads that have more than <int> distinct,
                     valid alignments, hisat2 does not guarantee that the <int> alignments reported are the best possible
                     in terms of alignment score. Default: 5 (linear index) or 10 (graph index).
                     Note: HISAT2 is not designed with large values for -k in mind, and when aligning reads to long,
                     repetitive genomes, large -k could make alignment much slower.
  --max-seeds <int>  HISAT2, like other aligners, uses seed-and-extend approaches. HISAT2 tries to extend seeds to
                     full-length alignments. In HISAT2, --max-seeds is used to control the maximum number of seeds that
                     will be extended. For DNA-read alignment (--no-spliced-alignment), HISAT2 extends up to these manyseeds
                     and skips the rest of the seeds. For RNA-read alignment, HISAT2 skips extending seeds and reports
                     no alignments if the number of seeds is larger than the number specified with the option,
                     to be compatible with previous versions of HISAT2. Large values for --max-seeds may improve alignment
                     sensitivity, but HISAT2 is not designed with large values for --max-seeds in mind, and when aligning
                     reads to long, repetitive genomes, large --max-seeds could make alignment much slower.
                     The default value is the maximum of 5 and the value that comes with -k times 2.
  -a/--all           HISAT2 reports all alignments it can find. Using the option is equivalent to using both --max-seeds

                     and -k with the maximum value that a 64-bit signed integer can represent (9,223,372,036,854,775,807).
  --repeat           report alignments to repeat sequences directly

 Paired-end:
  -I/--minins <int>  minimum fragment length (0), only valid with --no-spliced-alignment
  -X/--maxins <int>  maximum fragment length (500), only valid with --no-spliced-alignment
  --fr/--rf/--ff     -1, -2 mates align fw/rev, rev/fw, fw/fw (--fr)
  --no-mixed         suppress unpaired alignments for paired reads
  --no-discordant    suppress discordant alignments for paired reads

 Output:
  -t/--time          print wall-clock time taken by search phases
  --un <path>           write unpaired reads that didn't align to <path>
  --al <path>           write unpaired reads that aligned at least once to <path>
  --un-conc <path>      write pairs that didn't align concordantly to <path>
  --al-conc <path>      write pairs that aligned concordantly at least once to <path>
  (Note: for --un, --al, --un-conc, or --al-conc, add '-gz' to the option name, e.g.
  --un-gz <path>, to gzip compress output, or add '-bz2' to bzip2 compress output.)
  --summary-file <path> print alignment summary to this file.
  --new-summary         print alignment summary in a new style, which is more machine-friendly.
  --quiet               print nothing to stderr except serious errors
  --met-file <path>     send metrics to file at <path> (off)
  --met-stderr          send metrics to stderr (off)
  --met <int>           report internal counters & metrics every <int> secs (1)
  --no-head             suppress header lines, i.e. lines starting with @
  --no-sq               suppress @SQ header lines
  --rg-id <text>        set read group id, reflected in @RG line and RG:Z: opt field
  --rg <text>           add <text> ("lab:value") to @RG line of SAM header.
                        Note: @RG line only printed when --rg-id is set.
  --omit-sec-seq        put '*' in SEQ and QUAL fields for secondary alignments.
